# AI | Overview

## Working Theory on Ai Agents

The Field of Artificial Intelligence is far broader than LLM Products and services.  The underlying ecosystem being developed here, makes use an ecosystem of 'Made for AI' components. Yet, the outcome becomes the means to define an AI Agent that functions in a particular way, as is often now termed an 'LLM'.  In the case of these works, the working theory is to define structures that support the ability to run multiple AI Agents that are then defined to operate for various specified specialisations.  

Each; may have different, 
- Permissions
- Structures 
- Configurations
- Hardware Requirements
- Software Requirements

Users and systems may operate many of them simultaniously, some may be loaded to run a task or job of some-kind then unloaded, they may be defined to run indepedently and confidentially, then providing no information or some information for the use of other agents, etc.  

The interfaces for Agents may also differ, some may have access to sensors such as cameras, microphones and other types of sensors (ie: movement sensors, GPS, etc), others may not.  The use or configuration of AI agent configurations may or will differ based upon the end-user as is defined as a natural person or legal personality.

Importantly, in-order to make "LLM Software" progams that end-up being part of how many of these agents are defined to operate, the underlying information system needs to be configured in a particular way, to enable outcomes that are otherwise unable to be created; or, will not operate to the same or similar level of usefulness.

Historically, software agents were developed without the use of 'LLM' software.  Often, these examples used other technologies, that are now being incoporated into the Webizen Software environment; such as, Semantic Web and Local Programming Technologies. It is thought, that effective use of these technologies will result in an ability to create better 'ai agents'.  

## Personalisation (and Privacy)

The focus of these systems is to define operating software that is particularly focused upon 'human factors', the needs of human beings.  The derivatives range from works to support a prosthetic representation of a persons consciousness / 'mind-sphere', that'll act as a prosthetic extension of self; and is deeply personal, private and must be owned by the person (whilst most generally otherwise appear to be working towards solutions where 3rd parties own it, and then commodify it as a 'service' for revenue providers); other lesser elements, either require the ability to operate the systems privately or with declared permissions socially, or indeed otherwise publically or that derivatives are contributed permissively, to efforts for the broader benefit of human kind, whether it be through the distribution of derivatives that have 'lower resolution' (ie: not point data, but averages, etc.) or otherwise.  The means to decide how these functions are defined, is formed via a dynamic function that has various levels of duality, between the decisions made by software creators; as well as those then defined by end-users. 

## AI Foundations

The AI Foundations to these systems, is based upon the use of Semantic Web technologies.
