# Tasks

Presently, the main set of tasks relates to development, integration and documentation.  Yet, another area is about preparation for the potential interest that may come-about and if this occurs then there will be a need for people to help with community development and education, which most-often takes some months of effort (actual work, not calendar days) for the uninitiated to get some level of comprehension.  There is also future possible requirements relating to advocacy of various kinds both technical and social; and, the means to then work through complex 'liberal arts' issues, as are often associated with STEM fields and various complex implications that may be broad or specific to particular use-cases or industries.  

There is also a great deal of work that could be done in areas relating to law (particularly contract, IP, trade & Human Rights) and economics related fields.  If i were more optimistic, i'd also add 'standards development organisations' however i currently 'feel' as though they're kinda captured, with some involved able to whisper about support, but without official support; and, in some such circumstances official activities seemingly act to subvert, disrupt and seek to cauterize the possibility of alternatives becoming available, which isn't easily experienced continually, without upset and in circustances where persons are expected to respond with a smile; irraspective of the implications of others behaviours. 

As a consequence of the institutional hostility towards human rights supporting technological infrastructure,

Designs are seeking to focus on the use of tooling that has no commercial subscription charges associated to it.  Efforts are also sought to ensure that any changes that may be applied are able to be tracked as to support accountaiblity & safety.

Where requirements have no alternative, tooling is sought to be made available 'liberally' (meaning, high-accessibility); whilst in circumstances where alternatives do exist, interoperability and portability are sought to be supported.

Whilst the present focus for the hardware solutions is based on Intel & nVidia support, it is desirable to seek to ensure that libraries are defined in a manner that supports alternatives.  This is not always the case, particularly at this stage.

In some cases, dependencies will be defined based upon assuptions that social-factors will not act as to jepordise human rights and/or 'humanitarian ict' related reliance upon the use of thoes components; however, every plan should have a back-up plan that considers various disaster senarios and what steps and/or mitigation strategies may act to triage major problems, should they occur, and incorporate capacities to extend interfaces and/or functionality to support the implementation of thoes mitigation strategies, should they be developed or made necessary in future.

*Example: It is presently considered desirable to use Domain Names as the primary public identifier, which in-turn also seeks to support ICANN DNS as a depedency, however should this be found unreliable, an alternative needs to be activatable*
