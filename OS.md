# Operating System

The Device Operating System being used for development is currently running on Windows Pro (64 bit).  

The current plan is to test the feasibility, functionality and differences between systems that are built on Windows, as may make it easier for some people to manage, as well as an alternative that is thought likely to improve security through the use of [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/).  The software used also provides widespread support for Ubuntu and OSX, however this is not presently the focus.
