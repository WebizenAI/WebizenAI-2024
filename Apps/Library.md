# Semantic Library

The Semantic Library, is a complex emboidment.  It has a variety of different interfaces, underlying services and usful purposes. 

A series of notes will be produced to illustrate different functions, that will then end-up being brought together.  Presently, the method for integration is not entirely known. There are a few elements / components, that can provide different functionality aspects; whilst, an integration is then sought to be brought about to support a harmonised API.

This in-turn seeks to support the means to produce specific sorts of applications and functionalities, that are otherwise not able to be produced.
