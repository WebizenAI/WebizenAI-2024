# Ontological Design

Ontological Design, in this context, refers to a ethodology whereby artefacts and entities are defined.  These definitions become materially complex; and are largely implemented using semantic social web programming methodologies.

The foundational 'ontological' frameworks are employed computationally and then processed via 'fuzzy' or weighted systems, which then acts to improve the accuracy of results - particularly for 'LLMs'.  In future, it is believed that further investigation into computational geometry is required, alongside other adaptions for quantum computing applications; whilst, it seems unlikely that users will be purchasing quantum computing hardware anytime soon.
