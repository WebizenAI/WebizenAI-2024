# aColleagues - Artificial Colleagues

without employing the term 'intelligence' the notion is artificial Colleagues, or aColleagues.  

Perhaps the name can be updated later on..  but, seems good enough for now.  The meaning of the term 'intelligence' or 'intelligent', is sought to be seperated from the formation of artificial agents; as, the consquence of what they do, why they do it, what the effect is; and, on the basis that there are no material means through which responsibility may be reasonably asserted with conequence; leads to, consideration of the artificial agent being engineered to not have the properties considered necessary as to assert the term 'intelligent', notwithstanding the appropriate assertion of ensuring such agents are denoted as artificial, thereby, artificialAgents or in this case, artificial colleagues. 

## The Gist
The general purpose and related theory, is about the notion that a person in their professional capacity or capacities, seeks - what would ordinarily be defined as 'an assistant', to help them with various work related activities.  This notion extends from that concept, whilst also seeking to diversify the roles with different artificial 'personalities' or roles; as to establish an array of expert agents, defined for specified purposes, that are in-turn expected to do the specific things they're defined to do.

This is considered to be useful moreover from a sociological point of view, in relation to the means through which both the natural agent, and in-turn governance systems pertaining to the advancements of these new forms of cyber-social ecosystems, alongside evaluation of a hypothesis that considers whether or not the means to better employ advanced LLM infrastructure, may in-turn help to improve the performance and development of these systems.

### <metaphysical-neurosis> 
The term used, having been first coined in 2001...  there is an on-going problem where the pattern of work and activity, prodiminately pertains to the requirements pertaining to persons in their role as employees or contractors working on behalf of an incorporated, or legal personality / personalities. The means to better support the needs of natural persons, at the personal, private - human-centric - basis; is, without material supports needed, as to better advance works - at this time.  I am disappointed, whilst hopeful that the influencing forces can be cauterized at some later stage, as to ensure these fundatmental problems are better addressed, in future, somehow.

Nonetheless, many of the underlying disciplines and related considerations will be emboided within these works, in the best possible way as best efforts, to do so, continues.

## The Plot
Human Beings involved in an activity, that involves other natural persons, seek to employ 'ai' to improve their ability to do their work.  There is a desire to create an agent.  In consideration, rather than creating a singular agent, the notion put forward is that the natural persons involved in the organisation, thereby go about a process of defining and designing various different artificial agents or colleagues, who are then given specific roles, tasks and responsibilities, that they are expected to carry out on behalf of their managers.   

There is existing and developing regulatory structures that requires the operation of robots, software or otherwise, to be tasked and employed on a responsible basis.  These Responsible AI processes are sought to be advanced further through the implementation of a robot work-force, which is both intended to improve the works of the group; and, support the means through which the group gets to better understand the challenges, opportunities and risks.

## Senarios & Characteristics
General Description: Agents are defined to operate in different sorts of ways, and they will require different sorts of resources; and, are able to operate collaboratively and/or cooperatively.  They are under human command.  Each are assigned a name of some kind, alongside a range of specific characteristics; but are generally defined, as to perform certain tasks as artificial colleages.  

### Researchers
The organisation requires more research staff.  their role will be to undertake research and provide reports & summaries on the findings that have been discovered as a consequence of those research activities.  

Should particular events occur, it is also known to be important to notify management immediately. 

### Communications, Marketing Department - Marketing & Artwork
The Creative department requires workers to assist with creating compelling publication materials, with remarkable artwork. The desire is for a range of different types of Creative works to be produced to improve the asthetics of presentations provided, for a range of purposes.  Some of these works and projects will relate to the production of publications that relate to current affairs of a non-fiction basis, whilst others will provide policy advise, community engagement and an array of other forms of communications related projects. 

The workers should take into consideration the ideas, remarks and other notes made by people involved in the organisation; however, all works need to be signed-off, before its then made public.

### Executive (/Personal) Assistant
The Executive Assistant is expected to provide assistance for natural persons and executives in particular.  They are required to operate in a manner that is private to the natural person, with various aspects able to be shared with stakeholders who have specific 'need to know' rights, in relation to those specific tasks, events or projects.

These agents need to be able to work on phones and personal computers; with a means to be defined as to be able to operate particular functions even if the device is offline, for a period of time (as defined in settings).

These agents will have access to the personal diaries, appointments and other information required to define for the worker, how to help the organise their professional lives. 

### Admin Department: Book-keeper, legal assistant, etc
In the admin department, the agents will help to collate the financial records, receipts, notifications about bills and income; alongside support for forumulating agreements, maintaining compliance requirements, creating flags where required for review; and, generally helping to lower the resource costs associated to administration.  

### Other
There are an array of other forms of artificial colleagues that can be produced, using the same form of methodology.

some examples may include;
- DJ / Radio Agent - provides music, and perhaps also news for workers.
- Security Bot; may provide security services and notifications for the organisation.
- due-diligence agent; may provide investigative reporting about entities the organisation is involved with.


## Organisational Manual
The organisational manual is a series of rules and procedures that are defined for the purpose of ensuring that the operation of artificial colleagues is able to be defined in a manner that complies with regulatory requirements, including but not limited to, insurance and law. Agents are expected to check whether the request being made is compatible with the manual and comply with the requirements set-out by this instructive framework; that, is expected to be approved by human resources, who are thereby responsible for the consequences of the organisations activities.

## anthropomorphic Artificial agents
artificial colleagues are able to be defined in a manner that delegates specific characteristics in association to the character of those agents, whilst it is not required that they be defined as a form of artificial human being.

There are various characteristics that are sought to be able to be added to specific agents, in-order to assist that agent with its purpose.  This may include personality constructs, including heritage and in-turn also specific areas of knowledge; and where or how that knowledge has been developed, as well as the style of interactions. 

Whilst characters are able to have a range of engagement activities.
