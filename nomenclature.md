# Nomenclature 

The term Nomenclature refers to the use of words to provide meaning, upon which basis a form of 'common sense' can be forged.  Historically, there have been differences between regions, examples include terms such as 'thongs' which in Australian, refers to a form of footwear, sometimes otherwise known as 'flip-flops'.  

## History

ELements of this project have been developed since, at least, the 1980s/1990s, via various groups around the world, that have illustrated similar sorts of principles, although contextualised in relation to the technological capacities at the time, or the medium (ie: sci-fi vs. lab-work).  These fluidities have continued to evolve, particularly over recent years, where the intended meaning of terms as defined by cohorts in different parts of the world whether independently, loosely or disjointly affilated in ways known or unknown; have been developed, considered and supported, then subject to competitive forces that has in some cases then led to changes to the meaningful definitions of those terms; whilst the coverage of the use of the term may have grown from a few people, to billions of people, this nonetheless does form interference between intended meanings per technical design plans vs. outcomes.  

As such, the need to accept any inabilities to fix the meaning of wording that has been given new definitions by competitively 'successful' actors, and to then continue to seek-out better descriptions, words and terms as to ensure the means to distinguish and make distinctions, is an unfortunate necessity.

At the same time, technology evolves. So, functions that were not considered earlier then become part of more modern designs; and, this in-turn can be taken into account as a consequence of having lost affinity to or with older terms.

## Limitations

The somewhat exploitative process of defining new things that others then employ as resources, is a messy reality. 

There are aspects where there are no known ways to create sufficient protection from the threat of the same process occuring on an on-going basis, other than by way of seeking to be both creative but also exacting in relation to the use of terms. This problem is not merely an issue for Information Technology sectors, and is targeted purposefully by threat actors, as to damage potential for any competition to emerge that may be disruptive to thoes stakeholders or inferior processes or wrong-doings aided by an inability to better address any such forms of otherwise indeterminate problems.

## Specifics

The Term 'human centric', 'human centric ai', and more recently also 'human centric internet', was closely affilitated to the development of these works and underlying 'standards' from around 2015; however the meaning of these words for most, has since changed to modelling that is not similar to the emboidment described by these works, as has been sought to be achieved since long before 2010...  although evolving..  

As such, the term 'humanitarian ict' was defined, as to consider the importance of ensuring the basic needs of human beings, the rights people are considered to have naturally, as considered to be 'god given' not gifted by a government or similar; should be foundationally incorporated into the technological designs of tooling, that human lives depend upon.

Additionally, the term 'Large Language Model' is considered to be misleading.  The tooling that provides large-language models include WordNet and similar; whereas, large learning models, better describes the emboidments created by these newer tools.   In this example, it may be feasible and practically helpful to internally associate terminology differently. 

These forms of 'internal' language sets is common, APIs being a straight-forward example; whilst different to 'external' terms.  There are functional requirements to understand how to better support the interactions and functional designs, alongside efforts to seek to form universal commonalities associated with our humanity, as members of our human family; as well as engendered means to better support, our capacity to advance useful arts and sciences in this particular domain.

It should also be noted; that sometimes, it becomes beneficial to employ older terms, rather than creating new ones.  Provenance studies are encouraged, as to understand the heritage and related characteristics which may in-turn lead to discovery of a previously unknown term, that offers an opportunity to redefine context in relation to the realisation of functional capabilities that may have been considered historically, lost, or 'out of fashion' (IE: shoulder-pads vs. flairs)

### Practical Desires

Generally, words should have a meaningful relationship to the ordinary use of that term; or, sometimes, the opposite, but mostly not.  For the most part, finding terms, in whatever language, that suitably or adaptly describe the notion, is preferred.  If it is feasible to employ words from different languages, that would be a welcomed constituency to broader philophical design characteristics associated with the growth of systems for our humanity, at large.  Similarly, translation tables need to be considered and at times, usefully supported...
