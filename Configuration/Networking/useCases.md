# Networking (& AUTH) Use-Cases

There are really two objectives that end-up being loosely coupled.

## Inter-personal agency

It is important that there is a generic method for social-auth, where users may be employing different platforms.  It is assumed that 'solid' authentication will be one of the major ways this is achieved.  The focus of Webizen is to seek to ensure that local-host systems are focused on the means for people to be their own 'platform provider', defining their own lives, maintaining agency over the systems that relate to their own human agency, and those whom they have a responsibility of guardianship such as elderly family members, those with severe disability and children. 

There are competing forces that are likely to lead to different ways in which people in a local-host users community defines their own computing environment, whether it is consistant with the principals of local-host based systems, or not.  

## Compatibility 

Functionality in cooperative systems need to have commonalities in-order for those systems to support interoperability requirements. This may not always be the case, whilst effort to ensure the basics are interoperably supported by local-host systems, is considered to be somewhere between desirable and a requirement.

There are some functions intended to be deployed within the webizen systems that have been designed for specific purposes, that may hinder commpatibility, whilst specifications are sought to be made available where appropriate; but are otherwise going to be implemented even if it creates incompatibility with 3rd party systems.

**An Example is:** that it is desirable to address SPAM, and it is believed this can be done by issuing alias to relationships, rather than simply using a single email alias.  THis change can be brought about, as a consequence of the webizen using a domain name, not simply a 3rd party email address or similar.   This use of email alias with WebID related ecosystems, is not known to be operationally implemented elsewhere.


The specifications will be defined in a manner that seeks to define how webizen is to be implemented, whilst seeking to make good choices to limit social-web disruptions that may cause compatibility issues.

## Webizen Use-Cases

### Networking

The networking methodology seeks to use RDF in a manner simmilar to WebID-TLS|RSA on the Domain Name, Wireguard Networking Connections (personal network) via tailscale or similar; as part of a broader agent relations 'fabric', that enables semantic rules, inferencing / Logical programming, and hopefully transparent AUTH to local apps, stored locally, running locally operating services (then authenticated with external services, where required) that are sought to be produced using fairly simple HTML5 methods; including but not limited to, the means to support a 'social web' web-extension(s).  

The Usage Paradigm seeks to provide social experiences in relation to URIs that are both permissively available based on agreed permissions between agents; enabling a sort of 'web of data' communications system, that is loosely coupled with applications running locally.  An example of this is demonstrated by [Cimba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhwAiTOFPrc)
